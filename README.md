Welcome to Our Code Haven!
Greetings, Earthlings! 🌍 Prepare to be dazzled by the brilliance of Team SuperIntel Developers & Omer the Non-Intel Whiz. We're embarking on a coding odyssey for our Open University web app project, and we're here to share a sneak peek into the magic behind our screens.

Meet the Geniuses:
Ben - The Brainiac:

Superpower: Can turn tea into code. Seriously, we're convinced he's part machine.
Gal - The Code Galactica:

Secret Weapon: Multitasking. Can juggle more tasks than a circus performer on rollerblades.
Mor - The Coding Maestro:

Claim to Fame: Once debugged a colleague's dream. No nightmare-inducing bugs allowed.
Yoni - The Chip Charmer:

Mood Booster: Sings to the servers to keep them happy. A real-life server whisperer.
Omer - The Rebel Without an Intel Cause:

Battle Cry: "No Intel inside, but plenty of innovation outside!"
Our Quest:
To create a web app so epic that even the most seasoned developers will gaze upon it in awe. Intel Developers, brace yourselves for a journey filled with creativity, innovation, and maybe a touch of rebelliousness from Omer.

Ground Rules (or Lack Thereof):
Ben's keyboard is not to be touched without protective gear. The sheer speed of his typing may cause injury.
Gal will be speaking in JavaScript. Don't worry; it's contagious and perfectly normal.
Mor's coding hat is non-negotiable. It's the source of his coding superpowers.
Yoni's servers have a taste for '80s rock. If they seem sluggish, play some Queen or AC/DC.
Communication Nexus:
For official transmissions, we rely on a high-tech communication hub known as Whatsapp . For unofficial banter, we use carrier pigeons because we're classy like that. Omer, we'll teach you the pigeon-whispering technique soon.

Laughter is Our Debugging Fuel:
If in doubt, crack a joke. Laughter is our secret weapon against stubborn bugs.

Now, strap in, fellow coders, as we venture into the realms of coding greatness. Our code shall echo through the corridors of cyberspace for generations to come! 🚀💻 #SuperIntelDevelopersAndOmer
